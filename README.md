# Ansible controller and agent nodes set up guide
![ansible](ansible.png)

- ansible controller can be used to configure vagrant machines and cloud instances
- ansible vault can be used to help secure access keys
- ansible performs well in cases of 100s of servers
- the file /etc/ansible/hosts in the controller is used for instance details to connect to the agents nodes - name and IP of nodes
- the playbook contains instructions for the controller
- ansible has a python dependency, available by default on ubutu 18.04

## We will use 18.04 ubuntu for ansible controller and agent nodes set up 
### Please ensure to refer back to your vagrant documentation

- **You may need to reinstall plugins or dependencies required depending on the OS you are using.**
